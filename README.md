<h1>Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis</h1>
	<h2>Project Summary</h2>
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, formerly a global movie rental chain, aims to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive with platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The management has tasked the Business Intelligence (BI) department with developing a data-driven launch strategy for this new venture. The analysis focusses on organizing Rockbuster's historical data in a relational database (RDBMS), using SQL to address key business queries, and providing actionable insights through visualizations. The findings will be presented to Rockbuster’s management team to inform strategic decisions for a successful online transition.
    <h2>Key Questions & Objectives</h2>
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions, and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020   company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:   

● Which  movies  contributed  the  most/least  to  revenue  gain?     
● What  was  the  average  rental  duration  for  all  videos?   
● Which  countries  are  Rockbuster  customers  based  in?   
● Where  are  customers  with  a  high  lifetime  value  based?   
● Do  sales  figures  vary  between  geographic  regions?
